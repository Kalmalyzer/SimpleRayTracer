Simple ray tracer
-----------------

version 1.0, April 2004
-----------------------


This is supposed to be a very simple, minimal raytracer, mainly for educational purposes.



Building
--------
There is a MSVC++ 6.0 workspace included - the file /simpleraytracer/winsimpleraytracer.dsw.

Hopefully u should be able to build the project from this: if not you can always run the 
executable.

Build it in release mode for optimum speed.
